# Partner Journey Optimization Project

## Project Overview
Analyzing and optimizing the partner journey across different segments, focusing on two critical phases:
- Conversion (lead to account creation)
- Activation (account creation to first live order)

## Segments
1. **SMB-Unmanaged** 
   - Hobbyists or small business. Users just trying to get started in Print-on-Demand. 
   - Self-service focused
   - Price sensitive
   - Needs simple, clear workflows
	   - Store connection
	   - Artwork management
	   - Product creation and syncing to store
	   - Intuitive order management

2. **SMB-Managed** 
   - Growth focused
   - Needs guided optimization in migrating their business to Gooten
   - Values support access

3. **Mid-Market/Enterprise**
   - Scale focused

   - Demands high quality assurance

## Common Journey Steps
All segments follow broadly the same journey, with varying needs and complexities:

### Conversion Phase

2. Account Creation
3. Dashboard Access
4. Initial Setup (billing, tax, routing, pricing, etc.)

### Activation Phase
1. Prerequisite to first live order

		2. SKU selection
		3. Design upload
		4. Preview and publish
	2. Store Connection

2. First Order

   - Manual order not included (this often overlaps with sample)
   - Test order not included

## Analysis Framework
For each step, we analyze:

1. **Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)**
   - What is the user trying to accomplish?
   - Why do they need this step?
   - What's their end goal?

2. **Pain Points**
   - What makes this step difficult?
   - Where do users get stuck?
   - Why do they drop off?

3. **Required Actions**
   - What must the partner do?
   - What must Gooten do?
   - What support is needed?

## Key Metrics
1. **Conversion**
   - Lead to signup rate
   - Form completion rate
   - Account creation success

2. **Activation**
   - Time to first order
   - Drop-off points
   - Success rate (~3% currently)

## Project Goals
1. Identify user journey for users in each segment
2. Identify user motivations, needs, goals
3. Identify friction points in user journey
